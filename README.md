# Harry-Potter-House-Sorting-Clustering-Model-Based-upon-Psychometrics-

## Project description. 
Used Tableau software to carry out Unsupervised Clustering Model on harry_personality_cleancsv file (719 rows) which consists of processed data (collected by participants who have taken the Sorting Hat quiz) that are presented according to the psychology metrics and scores. This is because some studies suggested that the Sorting Hat Quiz prepared by the author JK Rowling is related to empirically established personality traits. 4 clusters were created in Tableau to sort participants by personality and aspirations. Then each individual cluster is assigned to a particular house in Hogwarts.

## Clustering Model results
### Gryffindor: Bravery, Helping others and chivalry - mapped to blue cluster linked to personality traits of high emotional stability, extraversion.
### Hufflepuff: Hard Work, patience, loyalty and fair play - mapped to red cluster linked to personality traits of loyalty and fair play given low psychopathy, narcissim and machiavellianism.
### Ravenclaw: Intelligence, knowledge , planning ahead, and wit - mapped to yellow cluster linked to personality traits of high conscientiousness, high emotional stability, agreeableness.
### Slytherin: Ambition, cunningness, heritage and resourcefulness - mapped to green cluster linked to personality traits of psychopathy, narcissim, machiavellianism and low agreeableness.
